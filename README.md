ftd-bptools is a small utility library written in [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), intended to help with analysing and performing bulk modifications to `.blueprint` files generated by the game [From the Depths](https://fromthedepthsgame.com/). Block information is read directly from the game's data files, so the output should always be up to date and be able to handle any user modifications that may be present.

## Dependencies

The only non-standard package used by this library is `NumPy` for clean and efficient manipulation of block ID lists inside `.blueprint` files. You can install NumPy on most unix-like environments using:

```
pip3 install --user numpy
```

For more detailed instructions, see [NumPy's website](https://numpy.org/install/).

The remaining packages used by this library are all included in standard Python3 installations and should not require any additional setup.

## Installing

For now, installation consists of cloning this repository and either copying the source files to your working directory or adding them to your Python path.

## Usage Examples

See [analyse_bp.py](https://github.com/al-025/ftd-bptools/blob/master/analyse_bp.py) and [edit_bp.py](https://github.com/al-025/ftd-bptools/blob/master/edit_bp.py) for examples of how to use this library.

## To-do

- Restructure as a package for upload to PyPI (enables easy installation via pip)
